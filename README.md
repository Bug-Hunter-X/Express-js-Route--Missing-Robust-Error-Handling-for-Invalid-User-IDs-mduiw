# Express.js Route: Missing Robust Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling for invalid input.  The example shows a route that retrieves a user by ID.  The original code lacks proper error handling for cases where the user ID is not found or is not a valid number.

The improved solution provides more robust error handling, including specific error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
